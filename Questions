Q5)What is the process used in the project "Posture-Detection-using-PoseNet" ?

Ans=>The code provided appears to be written in JavaScript using the p5.js library for creating interactive graphics and animations. It utilizes the ml5.js library, specifically the PoseNet model, for performing pose 
     estimation on the video captured from the webcam.
     Regarding the architecture used in the project, the code snippet suggests the following components:
     1)Capture: The code uses the "createCapture()" function to create a video capture object that accesses the webcam feed.
     2)PoseNet Initialization: The code initializes the PoseNet model using the "ml5.poseNet()" function. It passes the video capture object as input and specifies a callback function ("modelLoaded") to be executed 
     when the model has finished loading.
     3)Received Poses: The code defines a callback function ("receivedPoses") that is triggered whenever poses are detected by PoseNet. It retrieves the detected poses and assigns them to the "singlePose" and 
       "skeleton" variables for further processing.
     4)Model Loaded: The code defines the "modelLoaded" function, which is executed when the PoseNet model has finished loading. It serves as a confirmation that the model is ready for inference.
     5)Drawing: The "draw()" function is called continuously and handles the drawing of graphics on the canvas. It first displays the webcam feed using the "image()" function. Then, if there is a "singlePose", it 
       draws ellipses for each keypoint and lines for each connection defined in the "skeleton". Additional commented code suggests the possibility of overlaying images such as glasses ("specs") and a cigar ("smoke") 
       on specific keypoints.
     The architecture used in this project is a combination of p5.js for graphics and animation and ml5.js for the PoseNet model, enabling real-time pose estimation and visualization.

       "singlePose", "skeleton","actor_img", "specs", and "smoke" are declared. The "setup()" function is defined, which sets up the canvas size, creates a video capture object, hides the captured video, initializes
       PoseNet, and loads images.
     2)PoseNet Initialization: In the "setup()" function, the PoseNet model is initialized using the "ml5.poseNet()" function. It takes the video capture object ("capture") as input and specifies a callback function
       ("modelLoaded") to execute when the model has finished loading.
     3)Received Poses: The "receivedPoses()" function is defined as a callback function that is triggered whenever poses are detected by PoseNet. It receives the detected poses as input ("poses") and checks if there
       is at least one pose. If so, it assigns the first pose to the "singlePose" variable and the associated skeleton to the "skeleton" variable.
     4)Model Loaded: The "modelLoaded()" function is defined as the callback function that is executed when the PoseNet model has finished loading. In the given code, it simply logs a message to the console
       indicating that the model has loaded.
     5)Drawing: The "draw()" function is continuously called by p5.js and handles the rendering of graphics on the canvas. It starts by displaying the captured video using the "image()" function. If there is a 
       valid "singlePose", it iterates over each keypoint and draws ellipses at their positions. It also iterates over the skeleton connections and draws lines between the associated keypoints. The code also 
       contains commented-out lines that suggest the possibility of overlaying images ("specs" and "smoke") on specific keypoints like the nose.
